\maketitle

\section*{Preface}


The Journal of High-Performance Storage (JHPS) is a new open-access journal edited by storage experts that unite key features of journals fostering openness and trust in storage research. In particular, JHPS offers open reviews, living papers, digital replicability, and free open access.

The editing team is proud to announce the publication of the second JHPS issue. It contains two articles regarding the important topic of performance analysis. Since our last publication, we hardened the manuscript central\footnote{\url{https://jhps.vi4io.org/central/}} that we use to manage submissions.
With the ISSN 2748-7814 assigned, the journal is also now recognized as a serial publication. Now that we are confident in the effectiveness of the established workflows and tools, our goal is to foster the adoption of the journal and to refine the workflows for digital replicability.

version of all articles at the release date (newer versions of individual articles may exist due to our
“living paper” concept). 
Unfortunately, the embedded links in the PDF of individual articles are lost. 
We recommend you visit the webpage of the
